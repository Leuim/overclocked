## Description
OverClocked is a full-stack e-commerce web application where users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and place orders. Admins can manage categories, products, and view all order histories. The app was built to simulate a real shopping experience and to practice building CRUD operations, authentication, and order management in Django.
